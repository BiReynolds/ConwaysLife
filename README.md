# ConwaysLife

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton popularized by the Mathematician John Conway.  For more information on the rules of the game, as well as some fun patterns to try, check [the Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

In the current implementation, cells can be toggled on/off by clicking and the simulation can be started by pressing the SpaceBar.
